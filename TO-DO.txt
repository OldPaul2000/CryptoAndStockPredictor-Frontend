- 1.a: Fix window resize logic after complete chart development

- 2.a: Implement scroll increase checker to prevent currentScrollBarIndex number 
  to increment more than total chart bars number - visible charts
  (it counts from the very first bar to the left most bar)
- 2.b: Fix max left scroll value. When max scrolled, the value is not divisible by SCROLL_FACTOR anymore
  and when the graph is scrolled back the scrollLeft value keeps being
  not divisible by SCROLL_FACTOR and the chart bars are not framed correctly

- 3.a: Implement addChartBar functionality:
      * spread price scale elements evenly based on 
        graph height(graph height = scale-content height)
      * spread timestamp elements evenly
      * recalculate timestamp elements and price scale elements
        position on window resize
- 3.b(optional): make bars resizable by mouse wheel
